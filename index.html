  Now I know what you're thinking.
  "This site kinda sucks!"

  You're not wrong. At the moment, this website is just a placeholder.

  If I gave you this link and you came across this version of the website,
  either you're looking at an older version or I forgot to remove this comment.
  If either these scenarios are true, I'd be very grateful if you 
  shoot me an email (adrisj7@gmail.com), or preferably text me at (646)-321-4959 
  and yell at me to fix the damn site.

  Thanks!
